# Examples for COM531: Web Application Development
Professor [Karl Stolley](http://karlstolley.com), Illinois Institute of Technology, Fall 2012

> Looking for the source for the course syllabus? Itâ€™s here on the [``gh-pages`` branch](https://github.com/karlstolley/531/tree/gh-pages). The human-friendly pages themselves are at [http://karlstolley.github.com/531/](http://karlstolley.github.com/531/)

There are a few different branches in this repository that contain examples, demonstrations, and
other teaching materials from class, including:

  * ``gh-pages``, the course website and syllabus
  * ``myapp``, the first basic rails app built as a class as a teaching demonstration
